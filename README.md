# 🚀 Mates

### A Full-Stack Chat Application built to explore Production-Oriented Backend & DevOps Practices.

---

## 📖 Overview

**Mates** started as a learning project to explore Django REST Framework through building a real-world chat application.

Instead of stopping after implementing the application itself, the project gradually evolved into a complete platform focused on production-oriented software engineering practices.

The current version demonstrates how a multi-service application can be containerized, monitored, and automatically built using modern DevOps tooling.

# 🏗 Architecture

The application is organized as independent services communicating through Docker networks.

Each backend service owns its own database while Redis is shared between Celery workers.

Prometheus continuously scrapes infrastructure and application metrics while Grafana provides monitoring dashboards.

# 🔄 CI / CD

The project currently contains **5 GitHub Actions workflows**.

| Workflow | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| users-ci | Install dependencies and run pytest |
| users-cd | Build Docker image and publish to Docker Hub |
| chat-ci | Install dependencies and run pytest |
| chat-cd | Build Docker image and publish to Docker Hub |
| front-cd | Build frontend image and publish to Docker Hub |

Deployment through SSH is already prepared inside the workflows and can be enabled once a stable production server is available.
